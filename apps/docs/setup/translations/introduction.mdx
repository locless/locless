## Prerequisites

Currently this feature was created mostly for i18next library. But technically it's just a json files with translations. So feel free to explore! (Don't forget to share your projects with us in [Discord](https://locless.com/discord))

<Steps titleSize="h3">

<Step title="Create translations folder">
Create `translations` folder inside `locless` folder.

```bash
mkdir locless/translations
```
</Step>

<Step  title="Create a first translation">
Now we need to create a first translation file. Create a new file inside `locless/translations` folder.

You need to use a language code as a file name. For example `en-US.json` for english.
</Step>

<Step  title="Sync translations">
In order to sync translation files you can use `locless translations --pull` command. Or `locless translations --push` to push translations to the cloud.

Keep in mind that your teammates might edit files through a website, so don't forget to `pull` translations before you start working on your app. For safety Locless will reject any changes if you try to push translations with an old file version.
</Step>

<Step title="Use translations in your app">
Congratulations! You have translations in the cloud. Now you can use them everywhere by calling this url `https://api.locless.com/translations/<language_code>`.

If you are using i18next library, you can use something like [i18next-http-backend](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend)
</Step>
